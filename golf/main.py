"""
Design and implement a program to process golf scores.
The scores of four golfers are stored in a file called golf.txt
Each line represents one hole, and the file contains 18 lines.
Each line contains five values: par for the hole followed by the number of strokes each golfer used on that hole.
Store the total for par in the variable par.
Store the totals for the players in a list called players.
Determine the winner and produce a table showing how well each golfer did.
